# AdTimer

The goal of this project was to create a stop watch type of program to record what percentage of a TV program or movie was advertising and what percentage was actual show or movie content.

To operate the timer, the user must observe the show and hit the 'show' button when ever a segment of the show starts and hit the 'ads' button when a segment of ads starts.  The user must hit the 'stop' button when the the show ends.  Then the user hits the 'calculate' button causing the total viewing time and percentage ads to be displayed.

Despite the fact that I got the code working properly for this program, actually using it is a bit problematic.  The accuracy of the results depends on the attentiveness and reaction time of the user.  Also, ads that start off looking like they are part of the show could have a negative impact on the accuracy of the result.
